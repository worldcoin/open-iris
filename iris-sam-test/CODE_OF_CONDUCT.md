# Worldcoin Open Source Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Disruptive behavior
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

The Worldcoin open source community is united in its conviction that its open source materials not be used:

- For mass surveillance of individuals or for unlawful individual surveillance or other unlawful targeted actions, including on the basis on race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion; or
- In any activity or manner that violates, or supports, assists, facilitates, enables, constitutes or is otherwise deemed to be a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://www.un.org/en/universaldeclaration-human-rights/), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx), the International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (https://www.ilo.org/declaration/thedeclaration/textdeclaration/lang--en/index.htm), or any local laws implementing those instruments.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when there is a reasonable belief that an individual's behavior may have a negative impact on the project or its community.

## Enforcement

We encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement in a given project or to legal@worldcoin.org. All project and community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
