Running inference
================================

A simple inference run can be achieved by running source code below.

.. code-block:: python

    import cv2
    import iris

    # 1. Create IRISPipeline object
    iris_pipeline = iris.IRISPipeline()

    # 2. Load IR image of an eye
    img_pixels = cv2.imread("/path/to/ir/image", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

    # 3. Perform inference
    # Options for the `eye_side` argument are: ["left", "right"]
    output = iris_pipeline(iris.IRImage(img_data=img_pixels, image_id="image_id", eye_side="left")
